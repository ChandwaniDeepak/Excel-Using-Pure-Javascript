# Spreadsheet using pure JavaScript
User can add or remove rows.

User can add or remove columns.

Unique id is given to every cell inserted, like if the cell in column 'A' and row '1' will have id as 'A1', similarly for next column 'B' row '1' will be 'B1' and so on.

Arithmetic operations can be performed like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.

for addition we need to write '=(A1+A2)' and similarly for subtraction '=(A1-A2)', multiplication '=(A1*A2)' and for division '=(A1/A2)'.
in this A1 and A2 are the unique ids of the cells in which data is placed.
